# Voting_Power
A weighted voting system means each player is assigned a certain number of votes (eg States in the US, electoral votes). More votes clearly means more power, but how much? Eg the Banzhaf power index is one way to quantify the power of each player in such a system. This repository includes SAGE code for computing the Banzhaf power index.

# Voting_Power
A weighted voting system means each player is assigned a certain number of votes (eg States in the US, electoral votes). More votes clearly means more power, but how much? Eg the Banzhaf power index is one way to quantify the power of each player in such a system. This repository will soon contain SAGE code for computing the Banzhaf power index.
# Christian Roettger
I have a PhD in mathematics from the University of East Anglia. My areas of interest include Number Theory, Algebra, Analysis and their intersections. Eg my thesis concerned the asymptotic growth of the number of matrices with determinant 1 and entries in a ring of algebraic integers, given a bound for the height of the entries. These problems are closely related to Uniform Distribution, Exponential Sums, and Diophantine Approximation. 
Since 2001, I have been teaching at Iowa State University. Teaching has motivated me to experiment with technology projects. In Calculus, a great source of projects is computer graphics. For Discrete Math, I have used probabilistic primality tests, RSA encryption, Hill ciphers. 

# Software
I am using SAGE (www.sagemath.org, free and awesome!), sometimes also MAPLE and MATLAB.
